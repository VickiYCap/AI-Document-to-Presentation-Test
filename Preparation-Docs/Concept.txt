FRONTEND:
- User uploads a document (pdf for now)
                or
- User inputs a query for what they want

- Uploaded file/query gets connects to the backend

-human middleware frontend ui is probably needed

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BACKEND:
- LLM recieves the file and scrapes the file for important information

- If working on presentation slides we should have:
    - a hard coded set of presentation styles (JSON) that the LLM can choose between
    - EX: 
            {
                "type" : "title-slide",
                "title" : "{scraped title name}",
                "subtitle" : "{scraped subtitle}"
            },
             {
                "type" : "bullet-slide",
                "title" : "{scraped title name}",
                "bullets" : "{scraped information}"
            }
            .
            .(and so on)
            .

- There should probably be a human middleware to make sure the scraped information is correct
- The LLM takes the scraped information and inserts it into the code (most likely JSON)


- If working on graph style presentations 
    - IDK YET

How Claude Gamma seems to work
- reads document or prompt
- summarizes the content into slide ready points
- creates a .pptx file presentation
- follows user instructions for number of slides, structure, simple layout instructions
